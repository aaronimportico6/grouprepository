This program takes in a name, then takes in an age, and finally displays the information in the form of a sentence. 

When you are prompted with the question of what is your name, type in your name and press enter. Then when you are prompted with the question of what is your age, type in your age in the form of a number and then hit enter. The screen should display the information in a complete sentence.
